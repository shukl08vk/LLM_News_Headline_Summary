# LLM_News_Headline_Summary
This is a small project to get the top news Headlines from India and summarize it using Google's Gen AI model - Gemini and send daily mails to the Mail ID.

Description:-
First, I have used the website (https://gnews.io/ ) api to get the top headlines from India having all the details.
Then, Gemini Api has been setup from Google AI studio to use the Gemini model of Google to use LLM to better summarize the headlines and the long news into brief and meaningful one line
news and return it as a Json format.
Now finally, I have setup the autmation mail functionality using python SMTP module to send the mail with the short headlines for top news. Which will be received on mail every morning. 

It is a short but interesting project to motivate myself on starting GenAI and agentic AI journey further.

Thanks
